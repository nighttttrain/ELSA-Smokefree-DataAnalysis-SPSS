# ELSA-smokefree-SPSS

Smoking is a major cause of preventable illness and death. The UK government aims to be "smokefree" by 2030.  The objective is to examine how mental health, living habits, demographic, and socio-economic factors are associated with smoking behaviour.   

The ELSA Wave 7 dataset, which contains 8,249 old people above the age of 50, was used for the investigation. The Chi-square test and binary logistic regression were used to examine whether smoking behaviour has a significant relationship between dependent variables. The regression models were adjusted for depression, living habits, demographic, and socioeconomic variables.  
  
Of 8,249 participants, 907 and 7,342 were current smokers and non-smokers, respectively. The current smokers were significantly more likely to feel depressed, younger, with low social status and poor compared with non-smokers. Alcohol consumption also saw an association with smoking. Sleeping quality saw an association with smoking, the relationship however withdrew when accounting for all other factors. There was no gender association among whether elder smoke or not.
